# Caligo — Zero-Knowledge Privacy Protocol for Stellar

**Private, unlinkable XLM transfers powered by zk-SNARKs on Soroban.**

Caligo is a zero-knowledge mixer protocol that enables private transfers of XLM on the Stellar network. Using Groth16 zk-SNARK proofs and Poseidon hashing, Caligo breaks the on-chain link between depositors and recipients — making transactions truly private on Stellar.

> **Experimental Software — Security Review Required**
>
> This protocol is under active development and has **not yet undergone a third-party security audit**. It is provided for research, education, and testing purposes only. **Do not use with real funds on mainnet** until a comprehensive security review has been completed by an independent auditor. Use at your own risk.

## Why Caligo?

Stellar transactions are fully transparent by default — every transfer, sender, and recipient is visible on the public ledger. Caligo solves this by introducing a **privacy layer** for Stellar using zero-knowledge cryptography:

- **Deposit** a fixed amount of XLM into a shielded pool
- **Withdraw** to any fresh address using a zk-SNARK proof
- **No link** between deposit and withdrawal is visible on-chain
- **Optional relayer** routing hides your network identity

Caligo is inspired by privacy protocols like Tornado Cash, rebuilt from scratch for Stellar's Soroban smart contract platform.

### Key Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** — Groth16 proofs on BN254 verify withdrawal eligibility without revealing deposit identity
- **Poseidon Hashing** — Circuit-optimized hash function (~240 R1CS constraints vs ~25,000 for SHA-256)
- **Fixed-Denomination Pools** — Uniform deposit sizes maximize the anonymity set
- **Double-Spend Protection** — Nullifier tracking prevents any deposit from being withdrawn twice
- **Encrypted Note Backup** — AES-256-GCM encrypted deposit notes with PBKDF2 key derivation
- **Relayer Network** — Permissionless relayer registration with on-chain fee caps
- **Soroban Native** — Built entirely on Stellar's Soroban smart contract platform

### Components

| Component | Language | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **MixerPool Contract** | Rust (Soroban) | Core privacy pool — accepts deposits, verifies Groth16 proofs, pays withdrawals |
| **RelayerRegistry Contract** | Rust (Soroban) | Permissionless relayer registration with fee cap enforcement |
| **ZK Circuits** | Circom 2 | Groth16 withdrawal proof circuit with Poseidon hashing and Merkle inclusion |
| **Client SDK** | TypeScript | Secret generation, proof creation (with Web Worker support), note management, relayer discovery |
| **Relayer Server** | Rust (axum) | Receives proof payloads from clients, broadcasts withdrawal transactions, earns fees |
| **Indexer** | Rust (axum) | Off-chain Soroban event listener, Merkle tree mirror, REST API, optional PostgreSQL persistence |

---

## How It Works

### Deposit Flow

1. Client generates a random `secret` and `nullifier` (32 bytes each)
2. Computes `commitment = Poseidon(secret, nullifier)`
3. Sends exactly the pool denomination (e.g., 100 XLM) + commitment to the MixerPool contract
4. Contract appends commitment to the on-chain Merkle tree and updates root history
5. Client saves an encrypted deposit note locally

### Withdrawal Flow

1. Client fetches the Merkle path for their commitment from the indexer
2. Generates a Groth16 proof proving:
   - Knowledge of `secret` and `nullifier` such that `Poseidon(secret, nullifier)` is in the Merkle tree
   - `Poseidon(nullifier) == nullifierHash` (for double-spend tracking)
   - The proof is bound to a specific `recipient`, `relayer`, and `fee`
3. Submits the proof to the MixerPool contract (directly or via relayer)
4. Contract verifies the proof, checks the nullifier hasn't been spent, and transfers funds

**The proof reveals nothing about which deposit is being withdrawn.**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (latest stable) with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- **Soroban CLI** (`stellar-cli` or `soroban-cli`)
- **Node.js** (v18+) and npm
- **Circom 2** and **snarkjs** (for circuit compilation)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GrimyFishTank/caligo.git
cd caligo

# Install Rust + Soroban toolchain
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --locked soroban-cli

# Install circuit tools
npm install -g circom snarkjs

# Install client SDK dependencies
cd client && npm install && cd ..
```

### Build Contracts

```bash
# Build all Soroban contracts
stellar contract build

# Or build individually
stellar contract build --manifest-path contracts/mixer_pool/Cargo.toml
stellar contract build --manifest-path contracts/relayer_registry/Cargo.toml
```

### Build ZK Circuits

```bash
# Compile circuit and run trusted setup
npm run build:circuit
npm run setup

# This produces:
#   circuits/build/withdraw_js/withdraw.wasm  (proving WASM)
#   circuits/build/withdraw_0001.zkey          (proving key)
#   circuits/build/verification_key.json       (verification key)
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Contract tests (Rust)
cargo test

# Client SDK tests (TypeScript)
cd client && npm test

# E2E tests (requires circuit artifacts)
cd client && npx jest tests/e2e.test.ts
```

---

## Testnet Deployment

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your `DEPLOYER_SECRET_KEY`
2. Fund your account via [Stellar Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org)
3. Run the deployment script:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy.sh
```

This will:
- Build both contracts to WASM
- Deploy MixerPool and RelayerRegistry to Soroban testnet
- Initialize contracts with default parameters
- Output the contract IDs for your `.env`

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `POOL_DENOMINATION` | `10000000000` | Pool size in stroops (100 XLM) |
| `POOL_MAX_FEE` | `1000000000` | Max relayer fee (10 XLM) |
| `POOL_TREE_DEPTH` | `20` | Merkle tree depth (2^20 = ~1M deposits) |
| `POOL_ROOT_HISTORY_SIZE` | `500` | Number of historical roots kept valid |
| `RELAYER_MAX_FEE_BPS` | `100` | Max relayer fee in basis points (1%) |

---

## Cryptographic Design

### Hash Functions

| Context | Hash Function | Rationale |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Inside ZK circuits | Poseidon | ~240 R1CS constraints per hash |
| Client-side Merkle tree | Poseidon (circomlibjs) | Must match circuit exactly |
| On-chain (non-circuit) | SHA-256 (Soroban host fn) | Native, efficient |
| Address encoding | SHA-256 → mod p | Deterministic field element from Stellar address |

### Proving System

**Groth16** on the **BN254** curve was chosen for V1 because:
- Smallest proof size (~256 bytes)
- Lowest verifier cost (critical for Soroban's instruction budget)
- Benchmarked at ~23ms native, ~70-117ms estimated WASM — well within Soroban limits

The tradeoff is a **circuit-specific trusted setup ceremony** — required before mainnet deployment.

### Cross-Component Consistency

All three layers (contract, circuit, client SDK) must produce identical outputs for:
- **Poseidon hashing**: `light-poseidon` (Rust) ↔ `circomlibjs` (TypeScript) ↔ `circomlib` (Circom)
- **Address-to-field conversion**: `SHA-256(strkey_utf8) mod BN254_FIELD_ORDER`
- **Merkle tree computation**: Identical zero-value initialization and Poseidon node hashing

Cross-validation tests verify Rust and TypeScript implementations produce matching outputs for pinned test vectors.

---

## Security Model

### Guarantees

- **Unlinkability**: Deposits and withdrawals cannot be correlated by on-chain observers
- **Double-spend prevention**: Nullifier hashes are stored permanently; reuse is rejected
- **Proof binding**: Recipient, relayer, and fee are public inputs — proof is invalid if any are changed
- **Root validation**: Only roots in the contract's history window are accepted
- **Fee caps**: On-chain enforcement prevents relayer fee inflation

### Assumptions

- The Groth16 trusted setup ceremony is performed honestly (at least 1 honest participant)
- Users withdraw to fresh addresses with no prior transaction history
- Users securely back up their encrypted deposit notes
- The BN254 curve and Poseidon hash function remain cryptographically secure

### Known Limitations

- **Anonymity set** — Privacy strength depends on pool activity. Low-volume pools offer weaker privacy.
- **Note loss** — Lost deposit notes mean permanently lost funds (no on-chain recovery in V1)
- **Recipient visibility** — Withdrawal destination is a public input (use fresh addresses)
- **Root expiry** — Users must withdraw within the root history window (default: 500 deposits)
- **Proof generation time** — Client-side proof generation takes 5-15 seconds on mobile devices
